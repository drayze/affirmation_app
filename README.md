# affirmation_app

An app to change lives.

## Getting Started

Many people struggle with mental health, feelings of disenfranchisement from their own lives, or just a lack of motivation.  A lot of the time we just need to hear we are important.
Sometimes just knowing you're not alone can save your life.  I was inspired to write this app by a dear friend, who brought up the idea.
In thinking about my own struggles, I realized that was how I battle my demons, too.  By telling myself things to motivate and inspire, or 
sometimes things that would provoke anger in me, just to ignite a fire under myself, and help me find empowerment.  So, I hope that this app will help somepeople. 
If it helps just one person, then all the time I put into creating it, was time well spent. 

As for features, it starts with the affirmation. Next to that a wide range od color schemes to give users the ablity to see colors they enjoy not the colors selected for them.
Also, to display the date and time and I plan to incorporate some animations to give a little joy to the day.
