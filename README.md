# affirmation_app

An app to change lives.

## Getting Started

Many people struggle with mental health, feelings of detachment from their own lives, or just a lack of motivation. A lot of the time we just need to hear we are important. Sometimes just knowing you're not alone can save your life. I was inspired to write this app by a dear friend, who brought up the idea. In thinking about my own struggles, I realized that was how I battle my demons, too. By telling myself things to motivate and inspire, or sometimes things that would provoke anger in me, just to ignite a fire under myself, and help me find empowerment. So, I hope that this app will help some people. If it helps just one person, then all the time I put into creating it, was time well spent.

As for features, it starts with the affirmation. Next I have 4 set themes (the 4 Seasons).  An adjustable and cancelable daily local notification as a reminder, because we can use a little push sometimes.
An Image handling and camera feature to add a picture as a custom background. Images can do a lot for the mind, body, and spirit.
